# Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) with Capacity Constraints in Julia

This project provides an implementation of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) with capacity constraints using Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) in Julia with the GLPK solver.

## Features

- Solves the VRP with capacity constraints
- Calculates the total distance traveled by all vehicles
- Outputs the optimal routes for each vehicle

## Requirements

- Julia 1.6 or later
- GLPK.jl package

## Installation

1. Download and install Julia from [JuliaLang.org](https://julialang.org/downloads/).
2. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vrp-julia-glpk.git
   cd vrp-julia-glpk
